We will also explore some advanced topics, such as object-oriented programming and error handling.</p>"},{"location":"programming/Python3/getting-started-with-python3/#sample-python-code","title":"Sample Python Code","text":"<pre><code># This is a simple Python program that prints \"Hello, World!\"\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"programming/Python3/getting-started-with-python3/#variables-and-data-types","title":"Variables and Data Types","text":"<p>Variables are used to store values that can be used later in the program. In Python, variables are defined using the following syntax:</p> <pre><code>variable_name = value\n</code></pre> <p>For example, to define a variable named <code>name</code> with the value \"John\", you would use the following syntax:</p> <pre><code>name = \"John\"\n</code></pre> <p>You can then use the variable in your program by referencing it with its name:</p> <pre><code>print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"programming/Python3/getting-started-with-python3/#control-structures","title":"Control Structures","text":"<p>Control structures are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They allow you to make decisions and repeat blocks of code based on certain conditions.</p> <p>The most common control structures in Python are:</p> <ul> <li><code>if</code> statements: Used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true.</li> <li><code>for</code> loops: Used to iterate over a list of values and execute a block of code for each value.</li> <li><code>while</code> loops: Used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.</li> <li><code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements: Used to control the flow of execution within loops.</li> </ul> <p>Here is an example of an <code>if</code> statement:</p> conditional.py<pre><code>if age &gt;= 18:\n    print(\"You are an adult\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You are a minor\")\n</code></pre> <p>This script checks if the <code>age</code> variable is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, it prints \"You are an adult\". Otherwise, it prints \"You are a minor\".</p>"},{"location":"programming/Python3/getting-started-with-python3/#functions","title":"Functions","text":"<p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be called from within a program. They allow you to organize your code into smaller, more manageable pieces.</p> <p>To define a function, you use the following syntax:</p> <pre><code>def function_name(parameters):\n    # code to be executed\n</code></pre> <p>For example, here is a function that prints a message:</p> hello.py<pre><code>def say_hello():\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n</code></pre> <p>To call a function, you simply use its name followed by parentheses:</p> <pre><code>say_hello()\n</code></pre> <p>This will execute the <code>say_hello</code> function and print \"Hello, World!\".</p> <p>In addition to defining and calling functions, you can also pass arguments to functions. Arguments are values that are passed to a function when it is called. They allow you to customize the behavior of a function based on the values passed to it.</p> <p>Here is an example of a function that takes an argument:</p> <pre><code>def say_hello(name):\n    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n</code></pre> <p>To call this function, you would pass a value for the <code>name</code> argument:</p> <pre><code>say_hello(\"John\")\n</code></pre> <p>This will print \"Hello, John!\".</p>"},{"location":"programming/Python3/getting-started-with-python3/#modules","title":"Modules","text":"<p>Modules are collections of functions and variables that can be used in a program. They allow you to organize your code into reusable components and make it easier to manage and maintain.</p> <p>To use a module in your program, you need to import it using the <code>import</code> statement. For example, to import the <code>math</code> module, you would use the following syntax:</p> <pre><code>import math\n</code></pre> <p>Once the module is imported, you can use its functions and variables by prefixing them with the module name. For example, to use the <code>sqrt</code> function from the <code>math</code> module, you would use the following syntax:</p> <pre><code>math.sqrt(16)\n</code></pre> <p>This will calculate the square root of 16 and return 4.</p>"},{"location":"programming/Python3/getting-started-with-python3/#error-handling","title":"Error Handling","text":"<p>Error handling is an important aspect of programming, as it allows you to handle unexpected situations and prevent your program from crashing. In Python, you can use the <code>try</code> and <code>except</code> statements to handle errors.</p> <p>The <code>try</code> statement is used to enclose the code that might raise an error. If an error occurs within the <code>try</code> block, the code execution is immediately transferred to the <code>except</code> block.</p> <p>The <code>except</code> statement is used to specify the type of error that should be handled. You can also specify additional code to be executed when an error occurs.</p> <p>Here is an example of using <code>try</code> and <code>except</code> to handle a <code>ZeroDivisionError</code>:</p> <pre><code>try:\n    result = 10 / 0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero\")\n</code></pre> <p>This script attempts to divide 10 by 0, which will raise a <code>ZeroDivisionError</code>.

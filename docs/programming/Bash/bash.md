## Bash Scripting Basics

Bash is a powerful scripting language that is widely used in the Linux environment. It is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, from automating simple tasks to complex system administration tasks.

Bash scripts are typically written in plain text files with a .sh extension. They can be executed on the command line or from within a shell script.

    - Automating repetitive tasks
    - Running commands in parallel
    - Creating and managing processes
    - Working with files and directories
    - Handling user input
    - Integrating with other tools and scripts

In this section, we will cover the basics of Bash scripting, including variables, control structures, and functions. We will also explore some advanced topics, such as regular expressions and error handling.

By the end of this section, you will have a solid understanding of how to write and use Bash scripts, and you will be able to automate tasks and streamline your workflow.

### Variables

Variables are used to store values that can be used later in the script. In Bash, variables are defined using the following syntax:

```bash
variable_name=value
```

For example, to define a variable named `name` with the value "John", you would use the following syntax:

```bash
name="John"
```

You can then use the variable in your script by referencing it with its name:

```bash
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

### Control Structures

Control structures are used to control the flow of execution in a script. They allow you to make decisions and repeat blocks of code based on certain conditions.

The most common control structures in Bash are:

- `if` statements: Used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true.
- `for` loops: Used to iterate over a list of values and execute a block of code for each value.
- `while` loops: Used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.
- `case` statements: Used to compare a value against a set of patterns and execute a block of code based on the match.

Here is an example of an `if` statement:

```bash
if [ $name == "John" ]; then
    echo "Hello, John!"
else
    echo "Hello, stranger!"
fi
```

This script checks if the value of the `name` variable is equal to "John". If it is, it prints "Hello, John!". Otherwise, it prints "Hello, stranger!".

### Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be called from within a script. They allow you to organize your code into smaller, more manageable pieces.

To define a function, you use the following syntax:

```bash
function_name() {
    # code to be executed
}
```

For example, here is a function that prints a message:

```bash
function say_hello() {
    echo "Hello, World!"
}
```

To call a function, you simply use its name followed by parentheses:

```bash
say_hello
```

This will execute the `say_hello` function and print "Hello, World!".

In addition to defining and calling functions, you can also pass arguments to functions. Arguments are values that are passed to a function when it is called. They allow you to customize the behavior of a function based on the values passed to it.

Here is an example of a function that takes an argument:

```bash
function say_hello($name) {
    echo "Hello, $name!"
}
```

To call this function, you would pass a value for the `name` argument:

```bash
say_hello("John")
```

This will print "Hello, John!".

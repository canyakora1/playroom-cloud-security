    ## Benefits of Scripting
Scripting offers several benefits, including:   

- **Automation**: Scripting allows you to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing the risk of human error.
- **Flexibility**: Scripting languages are often more flexible than traditional programming languages, allowing you to quickly adapt to changing requirements.
- **Ease of Use**: Many scripting languages are designed to be easy to learn and use, making them accessible to a wide range of users.
- **Integration**: Scripting languages can often be easily integrated with other tools and systems, allowing you to create powerful workflows.



For example, to define a function named `greet` that takes a `name` parameter and prints a greeting message, you would use the following syntax:

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```
